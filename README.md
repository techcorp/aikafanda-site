This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## 📧 Email Integration Setup (Resend)

The contact form is connected to **Resend** for reliable and secure email delivery. To enable email notifications for new leads:

1. Create a free account at [Resend](https://resend.com/).
2. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
3. Update the credentials in `.env.local`:
   * `RESEND_API_KEY`: Your Resend API key (starts with `re_`).
   * `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL`: A verified domain email address inside your Resend dashboard (defaults to `onboarding@resend.dev` for testing).
   * `CONTACT_RECEIVER_EMAIL`: The recipient address where form notifications are sent (e.g. `technicalcorp700@gmail.com`).

Note: If no API key is specified, form submissions will run in sandbox/simulation mode where leads are safely outputted to the server console.
